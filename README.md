# Multilevel-Feedback-Queue-Scheduler
## Multi-level feedback queue scheduler designed using 4 linear queues.
* Q1 is Round Robin with time quantum 2 (RR2)
* Q2 is Round Robin with time quantum 4 (RR4)
* Q3 is Round Robin with time quantum 8 (RR8)
* Q4 follows first come first serve (FCFS)

## Result
For each process, its remaining time of processes (RT), total waiting time (WT) and total turnaround time (TAT) are obtained..
